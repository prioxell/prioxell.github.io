    <h2>About Prioxell</h2>
    <p>Prioxell is more than a brand—it's a movement. Born from the idea that the mind is most powerful when it’s organized, we started by designing a wooden to-do list holder to help people turn raw thoughts into action. What began as a simple idea has evolved into a complete productivity philosophy rooted in clarity, intentionality, and analog-first tools.</p>
    <p>Based in Kerala, India, our mission is to bring thoughtful design and meaningful structure into your everyday life—online and offline. We aim to revolutionize the way people organize their thoughts and act on them in a world filled with distractions.</p>
